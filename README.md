## ARMS-Data-API

USDA’s Economic Research Services (ERS) is making data from USDA’s Agriculture Resource Management Survey (ARMS) available through an Application Programming Interface (API) to better serve customers. The data in the API are available in JSON format and provide attribute-based querying. The data are also available in bulk files.

This page provides a brief explanation of the API to get you started. For user convenience, we provide demos using R: open source statistical programming language.

A list of variables, by report, is provided in section 3. An exhaustive list of all variables and detailed descriptions is found in the file AllVariables.csv.
